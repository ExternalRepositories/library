## Binary search trees

A binary search tree is a binary tree that satisfies the binary search property: the value in each node must be greater than or equal to any value stored in the left sub-tree, and less than or equal to any value stored in the right sub-tree.

### Self-balancing binary search trees

A self-balancing binary search tree is a binary search tree that automatically keeps its height small during insertions and deletions.
