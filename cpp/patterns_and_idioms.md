### Class design

> The five principles of class design [R.C.Martin]:
>
> 1. Single responsibility principle: a class should have one, and only one, reason to change.
> 2. Open-closed principle: you should be able to extend a class behavior, without modifying it.
> 3. Liskov substitution principle: derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes.
> 4. Interface segregation principle: make fine grained interfaces that are client specific.
> 5. Dependency inversion principle: depend on abstractions, not on concretions.
