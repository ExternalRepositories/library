## Execute-around

:link:

* [*C++ patterns: Executing around sequences* &ndash; K.Henney, EuroPLoP (2000)](https://hillside.net/europlop/HillsideEurope/Papers/EuroPLoP2000/2000_Henney_ExecutingAroundSequences.pdf)

### Execute-around object

> Execute-around object idiom abstracts the execution of a pair of actions that surround a sequence of statements, or a single action that follows a sequence.

:memo:

* This idiom is also known by the name of Resource acquisition is initialization (RAII).
* An example of this idiom is provided by smart pointers, e.g. by `std::unique_ptr`. See [The standard library &ndash; Smart pointers](std_library.md#smart-pointers).

### Execute-around proxy

> Execute-around proxy idiom applies execute-around object idiom for individual calls on an object.

### Execute-around pointer

> Execute-around pointer idiom defines an execute-around proxy idiom when the actions performed on a target object are the same for all functions.

:memo:

* This idiom can be used to "convert" a non-thread-safe class into a thread-safe one by automatically locking and unlocking a mutex when member functions are called.

* [*We make any object thread-safe* &ndash; AlexeyAB, CodeProject (2018)](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1183379/We-make-any-object-thread-safe)

### Execute-around function

> Execute-around function idiom safely groups and executes a sequence of statements that must be enclosed by a pair of actions, or followed by a single action.

## Opaque typedefs

* See also [*Opaque typedefs* &ndash; Core language](core-language.md#opaque-typedefs).

## Whole value

> A minimal example of the *"whole value"* pattern:
> ```cpp
> class Value {
> public:
>     explicit Value(int v) : v_(v) {}
>     operator int() const { return v_; }
> private:
>     int v_;
> };
> ```

## Design principles

:link:

* [*The principles of OOD* &ndash; R.C.Martin (2004)](http://www.butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.PrinciplesOfOod)

### Class design

> The five principles of class design [R.C.Martin]:
>
> 1. Single responsibility principle: a class should have one, and only one, reason to change.
> 2. Open-closed principle: you should be able to extend a class behavior, without modifying it.
> 3. Liskov substitution principle: derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes.
> 4. Interface segregation principle: make fine grained interfaces that are client specific.
> 5. Dependency inversion principle: depend on abstractions, not on concretions.
