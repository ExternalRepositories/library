## Stable marriage problem

> Problem: given `n` men and `n` women, where each person has ranked all members of the opposite sex in order of preference, marry the men and women together such that there are no two people of opposite sex who would both rather have each other than their current partners.

:memo:

* This problem is also known as the stable matching problem.
