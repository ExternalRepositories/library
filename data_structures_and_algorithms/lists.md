## Singly linked lists

> A singly linked list contains nodes which have a data field, and `next` field, which points to the next node in the list.

## Doubly linked lists

> A doubly linked list contains nodes which have a data field, and `next` and `prev` fields, which point to the next and to the previous nodes in the list, respectively.
