## Longest increasing subsequence

> Longest increasing subsequence problem is a task to find the longest monotonically increasing subsequence (not necessarily contiguous) within a given sequence.

:memo: **Notes**

* The dynamic programming solution has running time `O(NÂ²)`, and is not the most efficient one. The problem can be solved in `O(N log N)` time using binary search based algorithm, see [Sequence algorithms &ndash; Longest increasing subsequence](sequence-algorithms.md#longest-increasing-subsequence).
