## Linear integer partition

> Problem: partition (without reordering) a set of non-negative numbers into `k` ranges such that the maximum sum over all the ranges is minimized.

:memo: **Notes**

* This problem has another solution based on a binary search of the answer in the space of possible answers that is obtained using a greedy approach.
