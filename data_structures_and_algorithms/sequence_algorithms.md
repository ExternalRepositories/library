## Longest increasing subsequence

> Longest increasing subsequence problem is a task to find the longest monotonically increasing subsequence (not necessarily contiguous) within a given sequence.

:memo: **Notes**

* The dynamic programming solution (without additional tricks) has running time `O(NÂ²)`, and is not the most efficient one. The problem can be solved in `O(N log N)` time using an algorithm based on binary search.
* Binary search based algorithm is output-sensitive: if the size of the output, the length `K` of a subsequence, is taken into account, it requires `O(N log K)` time.
