# Memory and cache
## The CPU cache: instruction re-ordering made obvious

*Charles Bay* @ BoostCon (2016)

> This is an introductory discussion of the CPU cache, its anatomy, and its ever-growing role in hardware and software design. Modern performant systems are implemented with explicit knowledge of the CPU cache's structure and behavior. Discussion is made of CPU registers, CPU cache levels, the cache line, the data bus, the CPU instruction pipeline, the compiler's duty, and the tremendous hijinks performed by execution units within the processor core at runtime which leads to instruction re-ordering.
