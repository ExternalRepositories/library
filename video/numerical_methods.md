# Iterative solvers and preconditioners
## Krylov subspace solvers and preconditioners

*Kees Vuik* @ CEMRACS Summer school (2016)

> In these lecture notes an introduction to Krylov subspace solvers and preconditioners is presented. After a discretization of partial differential equations large, sparse systems of linear
equations has to be solved. Fast solution of these systems is very urgent nowadays. The size
of the problems can be 10<sup>13</sup> unknowns and 10<sup>13</sup> equations. Iterative solution methods are the
methods of choice for these large linear systems. We start with a short introduction of Basic
Iterative Methods. Thereafter preconditioned Krylov subspace methods, which are state of
the art, are described. A distinction is made between various classes of matrices.
